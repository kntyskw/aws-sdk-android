# AWS SDK for Android supporting Kinesis

The [AWS SDK for Android](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid) provides a library, code samples, and documentation for developers to build connected mobile applications using AWS.

The current version of the SDK (1.7.1.1 at the moment of writing) does not support Amazon Kinesis yet. This modified version includes Kinesis API library that is backported from AWS SDK for Java 1.7.5.

For more information about using the SDK, please reference the online
documentation here: [aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforandroid](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforandroid/)

For best practices for using the AWS SDK for Android, please consider following our [AWS Mobile Developer Blog](http://mobile.awsblog.com/)
